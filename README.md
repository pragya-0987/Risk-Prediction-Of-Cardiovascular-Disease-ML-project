Cardiovascular Disease Risk Prediction

This project predicts the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) using machine learning techniques on health and lifestyle data.

üìä Dataset

Size: 308,854 rows √ó 19 columns

Features Include:

General Health

Age, Sex, Height, Weight, BMI

Exercise, Smoking, Alcohol Consumption

Diet habits (Fruit, Vegetables, Fried Potato intake)

Medical History (Heart Disease, Diabetes, Cancer, Depression, Arthritis)

Regular Checkups

üéØ Objective

To analyze health and lifestyle factors and predict the likelihood of cardiovascular disease for early prevention and awareness.

‚öôÔ∏è Workflow

Data Preprocessing (cleaning, encoding, scaling).

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for insights.

Feature Engineering (BMI, lifestyle factors).

Model Training with Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and KNN.

Model Evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

‚úÖ Outcome

The project shows how health, lifestyle, and medical history factors influence CVD risk and demonstrates the potential of machine learning in healthcare prediction.
